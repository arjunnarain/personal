## The Idea

Developer tools have fundamentally shaped how we write software. Understanding their evolution might give us insights into future directions and opportunities.

## Current Thoughts

### Historical Waves

**Wave 1: Text Editors → IDEs**
- From vi/emacs to Visual Studio, Eclipse
- Integration of editing, compiling, debugging

**Wave 2: Version Control Evolution**  
- From CVS → SVN → Git
- Distributed workflows, branching models

**Wave 3: Cloud-Native Tools**
- GitHub, CI/CD, containerization
- Infrastructure as code

**Wave 4: AI-Assisted Development?**
- GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT for coding
- Potential paradigm shift in how we write code

### What Makes Tools Stick?

- **Solve real pain points** (Git solved merging hell)
- **Lower cognitive load** (IDEs reduce context switching)
- **Network effects** (everyone uses GitHub)
- **Integration with existing workflows**

### Current Frustrations

- Tool fatigue - too many options
- Configuration complexity
- Context switching between tools
- Learning curve for new tools

## Questions to Explore

- What are the current biggest pain points in developer experience?
- How will AI change the fundamental nature of programming?
- What lessons from past tool evolution can guide future development?
- How do developer tools influence the software we build?
